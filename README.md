# What-I-Learned


This is a repo of things I learn as I go! I was inspired to start this by seeing [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)'s and [chaucodes](https://github.com/chaucodes/What-I-Learned)'s TIL repo!

I felt this was a good way to retain what I learn and is a great way to recall things if I ever forget!
